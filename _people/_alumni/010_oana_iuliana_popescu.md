My PhD thesis focuses on explainable AI for graph neural networks with theoretical guarantees and the application of these methods to different domains like social networks and climate data. In parallel, I am working on the Petra-KIP (Persönliches transparentes KI-basiertes Portfolio für die Lehrerbildung) project which aims to assist students in their learning process with AI-supported self-reflection methods.
